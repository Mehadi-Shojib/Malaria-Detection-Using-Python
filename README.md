# Malaria-Detection using vgg-16 svm,knn

in this project first I have extracted feature of the dataset using vgg-16 pretrained model.Then printed some of the layer to see how vgg-16 detected.Then used own dense layer ,svm,knn.

SVM =50%
Knn=52%
Dense Layer=49%

all those models didnt performed well. Hence project is expected to being upgrade

Library:
Keras,Sklearn etc
